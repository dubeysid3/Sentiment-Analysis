2.0 out of 5 stars,2.0,"I had iphone 11, pretty decent phone and I was proud with that phone. The finishing of iPhone 11 was the best, super camera and nice display.This iPhone 15 is a huge letdown... Small phone, no white color available and camera, photo quality is below than average. Many issues are there... Phone heats up, many times phone volume gets down without any reason and you will miss important calls. Most funny issue is my phone frequently forgetting my face and you cant accept call. It freezes... You will see phone is ringing infront of you but, you can't accept that call...!!! I bought iPhone 15 @79999/- in the month of October and in January it is on sale, gone down to 65000/-... so huge fall in price in such short time...!!! Apple... clock is ticking... another Nokia...üòä"

2.0 out of 5 stars,2.0,It‚Äôs just like a mid range android phone which looks good (I guess a mid range one plus would be actually better). Nothing special and absolutely no value for money.

2.0 out of 5 stars,2.0,"I had iphone 11, pretty decent phone and I was proud with that phone. The finishing of iPhone 11 was the best, super camera and nice display.This iPhone 15 is a huge letdown... Small phone, no white color available and camera, photo quality is below than average. Many issues are there... Phone heats up, many times phone volume gets down without any reason and you will miss important calls. Most funny issue is my phone frequently forgetting my face and you cant accept call. It freezes... You will see phone is ringing infront of you but, you can't accept that call...!!! I bought iPhone 15 @79999/- in the month of October and in January it is on sale, gone down to 65000/-... so huge fall in price in such short time...!!! Apple... clock is ticking... another Nokia...üòä"
