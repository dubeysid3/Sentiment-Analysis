1.0 out of 5 stars,1.0,"Received a defective product from Amazon. There was a deep hairline crack in the screen while unboxing the brand new iPhone 15.Initially Amazon didn't take any action or resolution. After I reached out to Apple, got to know that there are no such policies that customer should only reachout to Apple after purchasing Apple products. Resellers like Amazon should be responsible for any kind of damages. Finally after highlighting this point with Amazon, I got my refund.Similar issue happend with the Samsung s24 which I recently purchased.Amazon selling completely defective products."
